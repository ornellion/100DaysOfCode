### Day 1: January 1, 2024 
*Originally started this on Day 0 but I preferred it this way*

**Today's Progress**: 

I am currently completing Codecademy's [Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-python-3-) course. I am 93% completed. 
Today I spent 1hr30 working on Python Code Challenges: Strings (Advanced).  

I created functions that: 
- Checked if a user's name is located within a greeting
- Extracted every other letter from a string and returned the resulting string
- Reversed the letters of a given string
- Made a "Spoonerism" (switched the first letters of two words)
- Added an exclamation mark to a string until it reached the desired length

**Thoughts**:

Compared to the first time I tackled Python Challenges, I feel like I'm identifying what I do and don't know a lot faster and knowing what to search for when my work throws an error. 

My current focus is getting to the solution but I'm also starting to pay attention to *how* I get to the solution. I'm starting to ask myself ow can I get to a point where writing one line and list comprehension are the norm rather than an "oh I see!" moment when I check the Codecademy solution. 

This is my first day using GitHub so I still need to figure out how to push code to GitHub to be able to link.

### Day 2: January 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I spent 1hr30 working on Python Code Challenges: Dictionaries. 

I created functions that:
- Sum up all of the values from the key-value pairs in the dictionary
- Retrieve the sum of the values of all even keys
- Adds 10 to every value and returns the modified dictionary
- Returns a list of all the values in a dictionary that are also keys
- Returns the key associated with the largest value in a dictionary

**Thoughts**:

I see the progress in my approach and my knowledge is slowly but surely coming together. I see that I have a similar issue with dictionaries as I do with indexes - I struggle with finding the correct syntax to call the information I want. I also need to get ahead of my bad habit of sticking unnecessary if statements all over the shop. 

---
### Day 3: January 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I spent 1hr 30 on Python Code Challenges: Dictionaries (Advanced) and Classes 

I created functions that: 
- Creates a new dictionary where the key is a word and the value is the length of the word
- Counts the frequency of each string within a list of elements
- Counts how many unique values are within a dictionary
- Calculates the number of people have the same first letter in their last name

For the Classes challenge I created a new class, initialised the instance variables and created an object from the class. 

**Thoughts**:
I see the benefit of having both simpler and more advanced challenges. Sometimes the simpler challenges are the hardest as I overthink, but then by the time I get to the more advanced challenges I have the foundations down. I'm 100& getting better at finding the solutions to my questions on StackOverFlow.

### Day 4: January 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I completed the Codecademy [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-python-3) Course! 

For the last Classes Code Challenge, I: 
- Created class methods
- Used a constructor to automatically assign values to instance variables
- Created class variables to update all the objects at once
- Created a class variable counter which increments and is assigned to an instance variable whenever the constructor is called 

**Thoughts**:
I'm on a 9 week study streak (started my coding journey October 17, 2023) and feel immensely proud to have stuck it out through the learning curve. The suggested next steps is to take the Intermediate Course and look at Technical Interview questions. 

---
### Day 5: January 5, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Decided to pivot to Full-Stack Engineering. Started with *Welcome to Full-Stack Engineering* Unit on Codecademy. Started with a broad overview of how the internet works. I simultaneously know and always forget that the World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. 

**Thoughts**:
Why the sudden pivot? I had the niggling feeling that I wasn't really Data Science path but I put that down to the learning curve and told myself to at least get to the off-platform project. My reaction was: immediately no. 

My previous roadblocks to learning web development was the learning curve that comes with JavaScript but I enjoyed the challenge of the OOP Python classes. I didn't consider pursuing Full-Stack development purely based on the idea that it's high competition. But it's also what I'm interested in. And one of my new year resolutions is to follow my curiosity. 

---

### Day 6: January 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Studied for 3 hours. Started to gain a high level understanding of how the Internet work & the languages used for Web Development. I also started [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) on freeCodeCamp and started working throught the *Building a Cat Photo App* course. 

**Thoughts**:
I'm glad that I started my coding journey with Python 3 and SQL. The fact that HTML & CSS are touted as beginner-friendly has always made me feel like there was something wrong with struggling to get my head around the syntax. However as I knew I would find Python completely alien, it allowed me to accept being wrong (sometimes for days at a time) and getting used to find different resources to plug any knowledge gaps. 

It also made me realised that I can't just have *one* resource or course going on at the same time. Another common piece of advice given to beginners is to only focus on one resource or language at a time, but if I hadn't started with Python, I'd still have the idea that JS was unapproachable when the problem was actually that I didn't have a grasp of the syntax and *just* using freeCodeCamp as a learning resource wasn't compatible with my learning style.

I'm excited for all I'm going to be able to build soon enough. And that is the biggest sign that I'm on the right path.

### Day 7: January 7, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: 
Codecademy: Completed an Introduction to Software Engineering. I now have a high-level understanding of what programming is, what a software engineer does and the different between front-end, back-end and full-stack engineering. Starting the Fundamentals of HTML, learning the foundation of HTML Elements. 

freeCodeCamp: Completed the Learn HTM *Building a Cat Photo App* course. Started the *Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu* course.

Also created my own GitHub repository to track my 100 Days of Code journey. 

**Thoughts**:
Learning HTML & CSS feels liike coming home to an old friend. 

I'm glad that I'm using two different resources. I feel like Codecademy covers my need to have a deeper understanding about why certain elements are used whereas freeCodeCamp provides a more practical application of the knowledge. 

---

### Day 8: January 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Codecademy: Completed an Introduction to HTML Elements. 
- freeCodeCamp: Progressed on *Building a Cafe Menu*
- Solved my first LeetCode problem: 2235. Add Two Integers 

**Thoughts**:
On days that I'm working I often feel short-changed as I only have limited time to study and also start to get to grips with things that adjacent to coding. Like LeetCode. It's one of those things that I've always thought I'd have to wait months to get to the point of even solving. 

Thanks to my basic knowledge of Python I have a language to start getting to grips with the problems, and eventually move onto JavaScript and SQL challenges. I was inspired by a TikToker who said they did a problem every day for 3 months from zero knowledge and so asked myself: how hard can it be to just start? 

---

### Day 9: January 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started learning HTML Document Standards
- freeCodeCamp: Completed *Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu*.
- Started *Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers* course 

**Thoughts**:
Studying was harder today than it has been so far so I focused on the freeCodeCamp classes as they're a little more prractical. Learning to show up even when I don't have the energy for it. 

---

### Day 10: January 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed HTML Document standards. Intro to MDN and debugging HTML.
- freeCodeCamp: Made progress wih *Building a Set of Colored Markers* 

**Thoughts**:
Appreciating the into to MDN and how to debug from the beginning. The higher-level explanations of the Codecademy course are also helpful - for example, understanding that whitespace and indentation are used to make the code readable but the actual position of the elements in a browser are independent. 

I also did not expect the in-depth information how colours work with the CSS Colors course. It's the first time I've understood the RGB model, as well as HSL and gradients. Up until now I've relied on copy&pasting the hex colours that I liked. 

---

### Day 11: January 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started learning about HTML Tables.
- freeCodeCamp: Completed *Building a Set of Colored Markers*
- Started *Learn HTM Forms by Building a Registration Form* 

**Thoughts**:
I'm very tired but glad I still woke up and made time to study before work. The foundations are coming together. 

---

### Day 12: January 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed HTML Tables, quiz & associated Wine Festival Schedule project
- freeCodeCamp: Continued with *Building a Registration Form*

**Thoughts**:
As the bigger, less-guided projects draw closer I'm worried if I'll be able to actually build them or if I'll repeat the pattern of being overwhelmed by the learning curve. I didn't really understand what was meant by "Tutorial Hell" until I realised it meant being stuck in the cycle of only being able to complete projects when following step-by-step guides but not being able to build anything independently. I don't want to be stuck there.  

I'm keeping a list of small projects that I want to complete before moving to the next chapter. One thing I've seen self-taught developers regret not spending time on doing is making sure they have a solid foundation. I want to make sure I feel confident in the basics rather than being hit with Imposter Syndrome as complexity increases.

I've also hit the wall where I feel like I'm not making much progress and have *so* far to go. But I also need to appreciate how far I *have* come. In the Full-Stack Engineering path alone, in the space of 1/Week I have completed 1/50 Units, 19% of Web Development Foundations (first unit out of 6) and already complete 73% of The Fundamentals of HTML. And that's alongside the freeCodeCamp curriculum and dabbling in Leetcode. 

I need to give myself grace and time to enjoy the journey. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

### Day 13: January 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Semantic HTML and associated New York City Blog Project
- Completed the Fundamentals of HTML 
- freeCodeCamp: Completed *Building a Registration Form* Course.
- Took a look at the Certification Project: Survey Form 

**Thoughts**:
It's already independent project time?? I swear I only started yesterday. Before I dive into the freeCodeCamp Certification project I'm going to take the time to recreate the smaller projects to get acquainted with how to use IDEs (I think my choice is going to be VSCode) and display the projects. 

I think for smaller projects I'll use CodePen and then for the certification/portfolio projects I'll use GitHub Pages. I guess we'll see! I'm both nervous and excited to get out of tutorials and into projects. 

---

### Day 14: January 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started the Fundamentals of CSS. Completed Setup and Syntax 
- Started on recreating the projects encountered so far
- Currently building a simple **Film Photo App** page 

**Thoughts**:
I really appreciate the more in-depth higher level knowledge I gain from also using Codecademy as a source. For example, even if using inline styles and internal stylesheets for CSS is not common practice, it's good to know that it's an option. 

I started recreating the first thing that I built on freeCodeCamp. While it is simple, by recreating it I have the chance to review why certain elements and attributes are used over others. And given that I also now I have CSS knowledge I didn't when I first started I can also make it visually appealing! 

I started on Codepen as the IDE allows you to visualise as you code and it's very beginner-friendly. I do eventually want to use VSCode but I wanted to start where I feel most comfortable.

### Day 15: January 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued with the Fundamentals of CSS. Learning about Selectors.
- Completed the HTML for my **Film Photo App** recreation 

**Thoughts**:
It is a simple HTML project but in recreating it myself I'm learning so much. For example, why the person who creates the web content isn't also the web developer. I think I've spent most of the past two days coming up with content. It's also the fun part. 

I'm tempted to add the CSS right away but I think I'm going to revise the CSS concepts first. Then mock-up what I want the final product to be based on the CSS I do know. And *then* from the create final products. 

I just need more hours in the day at this point.

### Day 16: January 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed CSS Selectors & quiz. 
- Started on my recreation of a Cafe Menu - theme: Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop (a fictional tea shop from the Harry Potter Universe)

**Thoughts**:
I like the word specificity. I remember the last time I tried to complete the freeCodeCamp program I just gave everything a class and an ID not really knowing what I was doing. 

Really lamenting the fact that I don't have all day to sit and code. I'm really enjoying breaking down what I learned and figuring out how I can apply it myself moving forward. I think that's been my favourite progressing over the last two weeks - I'm enjoying myself!

### Day 17: January 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Visual Rules & quiz
- Completed the HTML structure for Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop Menu
- Started working on the final visual in Figma 

**Thoughts**:
I've got a cold so I'm proud that I still considered coding today a priority. I do need rest but if I have time to scroll on socials, I have an hour to spare to code. 

Started using Figma to create the final look of the site. I'm using Figma because I know it's an industry design tool but depending on how I get on I might switch to Procreate as I'm much more familiar with that. Canva is also an option I suppose. The goal is to be able to be able to use CSS to create a final product rather than being limited by what I *think* I'm able to do with my current level of CSS.

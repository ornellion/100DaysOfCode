# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<!--
Inspired by the original repo that I forked. I created my own so that the contribution could be counted.

### Day [X]: February X, 2024

### Day 1: January 1, 2024 
*Originally started this on Day 0 but I preferred it this way*

**Today's Progress**: 

I am currently completing Codecademy's [Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-python-3-) course. I am 93% completed. 
Today I spent 1hr30 working on Python Code Challenges: Strings (Advanced).  

I created functions that: 
- Checked if a user's name is located within a greeting
- Extracted every other letter from a string and returned the resulting string
- Reversed the letters of a given string
- Made a "Spoonerism" (switched the first letters of two words)
- Added an exclamation mark to a string until it reached the desired length

**Thoughts**:

Compared to the first time I tackled Python Challenges, I feel like I'm identifying what I do and don't know a lot faster and knowing what to search for when my work throws an error. 

My current focus is getting to the solution but I'm also starting to pay attention to *how* I get to the solution. I'm starting to ask myself ow can I get to a point where writing one line and list comprehension are the norm rather than an "oh I see!" moment when I check the Codecademy solution. 

This is my first day using GitHub so I still need to figure out how to push code to GitHub to be able to link. 

---

### Day 2: January 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I spent 1hr30 working on Python Code Challenges: Dictionaries. 

I created functions that:
- Sum up all of the values from the key-value pairs in the dictionary
- Retrieve the sum of the values of all even keys
- Adds 10 to every value and returns the modified dictionary
- Returns a list of all the values in a dictionary that are also keys
- Returns the key associated with the largest value in a dictionary

**Thoughts**:

I see the progress in my approach and my knowledge is slowly but surely coming together. I see that I have a similar issue with dictionaries as I do with indexes - I struggle with finding the correct syntax to call the information I want. I also need to get ahead of my bad habit of sticking unnecessary if statements all over the shop. 

---
### Day 3: January 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I spent 1hr 30 on Python Code Challenges: Dictionaries (Advanced) and Classes 

I created functions that: 
- Creates a new dictionary where the key is a word and the value is the length of the word
- Counts the frequency of each string within a list of elements
- Counts how many unique values are within a dictionary
- Calculates the number of people have the same first letter in their last name

For the Classes challenge I created a new class, initialised the instance variables and created an object from the class. 

**Thoughts**:
I see the benefit of having both simpler and more advanced challenges. Sometimes the simpler challenges are the hardest as I overthink, but then by the time I get to the more advanced challenges I have the foundations down. I'm 100& getting better at finding the solutions to my questions on StackOverFlow. 

---

### Day 4: January 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I completed the Codecademy [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-python-3) Course! 

For the last Classes Code Challenge, I: 
- Created class methods
- Used a constructor to automatically assign values to instance variables
- Created class variables to update all the objects at once
- Created a class variable counter which increments and is assigned to an instance variable whenever the constructor is called 

**Thoughts**:
I'm on a 9 week study streak (started my coding journey October 17, 2023) and feel immensely proud to have stuck it out through the learning curve. The suggested next steps is to take the Intermediate Course and look at Technical Interview questions. 

---
### Day 5: January 5, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Decided to pivot to Full-Stack Engineering. Started with *Welcome to Full-Stack Engineering* Unit on Codecademy. Started with a broad overview of how the internet works. I simultaneously know and always forget that the World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. 

**Thoughts**:
Why the sudden pivot? I had the niggling feeling that I wasn't really Data Science path but I put that down to the learning curve and told myself to at least get to the off-platform project. My reaction was: immediately no. 

My previous roadblocks to learning web development was the learning curve that comes with JavaScript but I enjoyed the challenge of the OOP Python classes. I didn't consider pursuing Full-Stack development purely based on the idea that it's high competition. But it's also what I'm interested in. And one of my new year resolutions is to follow my curiosity. 

---

### Day 6: January 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Studied for 3 hours. Started to gain a high level understanding of how the Internet work & the languages used for Web Development. I also started [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) on freeCodeCamp and started working throught the *Building a Cat Photo App* course. 

**Thoughts**:
I'm glad that I started my coding journey with Python 3 and SQL. The fact that HTML & CSS are touted as beginner-friendly has always made me feel like there was something wrong with struggling to get my head around the syntax. However as I knew I would find Python completely alien, it allowed me to accept being wrong (sometimes for days at a time) and getting used to find different resources to plug any knowledge gaps. 

It also made me realised that I can't just have *one* resource or course going on at the same time. Another common piece of advice given to beginners is to only focus on one resource or language at a time, but if I hadn't started with Python, I'd still have the idea that JS was unapproachable when the problem was actually that I didn't have a grasp of the syntax and *just* using freeCodeCamp as a learning resource wasn't compatible with my learning style.

I'm excited for all I'm going to be able to build soon enough. And that is the biggest sign that I'm on the right path. 

---

### Day 7: January 7, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: 
Codecademy: Completed an Introduction to Software Engineering. I now have a high-level understanding of what programming is, what a software engineer does and the different between front-end, back-end and full-stack engineering. Starting the Fundamentals of HTML, learning the foundation of HTML Elements. 

freeCodeCamp: Completed the Learn HTM *Building a Cat Photo App* course. Started the *Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu* course.

Also created my own GitHub repository to track my 100 Days of Code journey. 

**Thoughts**:
Learning HTML & CSS feels liike coming home to an old friend. 

I'm glad that I'm using two different resources. I feel like Codecademy covers my need to have a deeper understanding about why certain elements are used whereas freeCodeCamp provides a more practical application of the knowledge. 

---

### Day 8: January 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Codecademy: Completed an Introduction to HTML Elements. 
- freeCodeCamp: Progressed on *Building a Cafe Menu*
- Solved my first LeetCode problem: 2235. Add Two Integers 

**Thoughts**:
On days that I'm working I often feel short-changed as I only have limited time to study and also start to get to grips with things that adjacent to coding. Like LeetCode. It's one of those things that I've always thought I'd have to wait months to get to the point of even solving. 

Thanks to my basic knowledge of Python I have a language to start getting to grips with the problems, and eventually move onto JavaScript and SQL challenges. I was inspired by a TikToker who said they did a problem every day for 3 months from zero knowledge and so asked myself: how hard can it be to just start? 

---

### Day 9: January 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started learning HTML Document Standards
- freeCodeCamp: Completed *Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu*.
- Started *Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers* course 

**Thoughts**:
Studying was harder today than it has been so far so I focused on the freeCodeCamp classes as they're a little more prractical. Learning to show up even when I don't have the energy for it. 

---

### Day 10: January 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed HTML Document standards. Intro to MDN and debugging HTML.
- freeCodeCamp: Made progress wih *Building a Set of Colored Markers* 

**Thoughts**:
Appreciating the into to MDN and how to debug from the beginning. The higher-level explanations of the Codecademy course are also helpful - for example, understanding that whitespace and indentation are used to make the code readable but the actual position of the elements in a browser are independent. 

I also did not expect the in-depth information how colours work with the CSS Colors course. It's the first time I've understood the RGB model, as well as HSL and gradients. Up until now I've relied on copy&pasting the hex colours that I liked. 

---

### Day 11: January 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started learning about HTML Tables.
- freeCodeCamp: Completed *Building a Set of Colored Markers*
- Started *Learn HTM Forms by Building a Registration Form* 

**Thoughts**:
I'm very tired but glad I still woke up and made time to study before work. The foundations are coming together. 

---

### Day 12: January 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed HTML Tables, quiz & associated Wine Festival Schedule project
- freeCodeCamp: Continued with *Building a Registration Form*

**Thoughts**:
As the bigger, less-guided projects draw closer I'm worried if I'll be able to actually build them or if I'll repeat the pattern of being overwhelmed by the learning curve. I didn't really understand what was meant by "Tutorial Hell" until I realised it meant being stuck in the cycle of only being able to complete projects when following step-by-step guides but not being able to build anything independently. I don't want to be stuck there.  

I'm keeping a list of small projects that I want to complete before moving to the next chapter. One thing I've seen self-taught developers regret not spending time on doing is making sure they have a solid foundation. I want to make sure I feel confident in the basics rather than being hit with Imposter Syndrome as complexity increases.

I've also hit the wall where I feel like I'm not making much progress and have *so* far to go. But I also need to appreciate how far I *have* come. In the Full-Stack Engineering path alone, in the space of 1/Week I have completed 1/50 Units, 19% of Web Development Foundations (first unit out of 6) and already complete 73% of The Fundamentals of HTML. And that's alongside the freeCodeCamp curriculum and dabbling in Leetcode. 

I need to give myself grace and time to enjoy the journey. It's a marathon, not a sprint. 

---

### Day 13: January 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Semantic HTML and associated New York City Blog Project
- Completed the Fundamentals of HTML 
- freeCodeCamp: Completed *Building a Registration Form* Course.
- Took a look at the Certification Project: Survey Form 

**Thoughts**:
It's already independent project time?? I swear I only started yesterday. Before I dive into the freeCodeCamp Certification project I'm going to take the time to recreate the smaller projects to get acquainted with how to use IDEs (I think my choice is going to be VSCode) and display the projects. 

I think for smaller projects I'll use CodePen and then for the certification/portfolio projects I'll use GitHub Pages. I guess we'll see! I'm both nervous and excited to get out of tutorials and into projects. 

---

### Day 14: January 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started the Fundamentals of CSS. Completed Setup and Syntax 
- Started on recreating the projects encountered so far
- Currently building a simple **Film Photo App** page 

**Thoughts**:
I really appreciate the more in-depth higher level knowledge I gain from also using Codecademy as a source. For example, even if using inline styles and internal stylesheets for CSS is not common practice, it's good to know that it's an option. 

I started recreating the first thing that I built on freeCodeCamp. While it is simple, by recreating it I have the chance to review why certain elements and attributes are used over others. And given that I also now I have CSS knowledge I didn't when I first started I can also make it visually appealing! 

I started on Codepen as the IDE allows you to visualise as you code and it's very beginner-friendly. I do eventually want to use VSCode but I wanted to start where I feel most comfortable.

### Day 15: January 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued with the Fundamentals of CSS. Learning about Selectors.
- Completed the HTML for my **Film Photo App** recreation 

**Thoughts**:
It is a simple HTML project but in recreating it myself I'm learning so much. For example, why the person who creates the web content isn't also the web developer. I think I've spent most of the past two days coming up with content. It's also the fun part. 

I'm tempted to add the CSS right away but I think I'm going to revise the CSS concepts first. Then mock-up what I want the final product to be based on the CSS I do know. And *then* from the create final products. 

I just need more hours in the day at this point.

### Day 16: January 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed CSS Selectors & quiz. 
- Started on my recreation of a Cafe Menu - theme: Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop (a fictional tea shop from the Harry Potter Universe)

**Thoughts**:
I like the word specificity. I remember the last time I tried to complete the freeCodeCamp program I just gave everything a class and an ID not really knowing what I was doing. 

Really lamenting the fact that I don't have all day to sit and code. I'm really enjoying breaking down what I learned and figuring out how I can apply it myself moving forward. I think that's been my favourite progressing over the last two weeks - I'm enjoying myself!

---

### Day 17: January 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Visual Rules & quiz
- Completed the HTML structure for Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop Menu
- Started working on the final visual in Figma 

**Thoughts**:
I've got a cold so I'm proud that I still considered coding today a priority. I do need rest but if I have time to scroll on socials, I have an hour to spare to code. 

Started using Figma to create the final look of the site. I'm using Figma because I know it's an industry design tool but depending on how I get on I might switch to Procreate as I'm much more familiar with that. Canva is also an option I suppose. The goal is to be able to be able to use CSS to create a final product rather than being limited by what I *think* I'm able to do with my current level of CSS.

---

### Day 18: January 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Healthy Recipes & Olivia Woodruff Portfolio related to Visual Rules
- Started studying The Box Model 
- Continued working on the design for Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop Menu in Figma 

**Thoughts**:
Actual props to designers because this is not as easy as it looks! I have all the components down and I used an image from the film to create a colour palette but it's currently...a garish mess. I'm definitely going to have to sit through a Figma tutorial at some point. 

I feel a little bit of dread as I start learning about the Box Model. I know it was one of those things that had me a little stumped when I first tried to learn CSS. I really hope that working on different projects as well as different resources will make it easier than it was before. 

---

### Day 19: January 19, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued learning about The Box Model 
- Completed my design for the Tea Shop Menu in Figma
- Started to work on the CSS of bringing it to life 

**Thoughts**:
The Codecademy explanation of The Box Model has actually helped close gaps that I had in my knowledge such as padding and margin shorthand. The regular referral to MDN Documentation means that I'm also learning to refer to it as a resource if I'm confused about anything. 

I had to stop trying to play around with the design of the Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop Menu once I had the basic components down. My designs will get fancier and more sophisticated as I go but for now I want to focus on the basic flow of HTML -> Design -> execute using CSS to match up as closely as possible.

I'm excited to see how the final product will compare to what I mocked up.

---

### Day 20: January 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed section on Box Model, including how to use Chrome DevTools
- Started Learning about CSS Positioning 
- Finished my Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop Menu Project! I took some creative liberties
- Downloaded Github Desktop, created a repository for GitHub Pages
- Created my first repository for a project 

**Thoughts**:
I enjoy having more time to code on my days off! I was itching to get through the more theoretical aspects of CSS (it can feel like a lot sometimes with Codecademy) and carry on with my project! 

It's only small but I'm proud of how much I've learned from taking the time to recreate a project. I've gotten to use Figma, Canva, Github & Github desktop. I'm also much more comfortable using developer resources like MDN Docummentation and W3Schools than I was before.

Here is the final product: 

![Screenshot 2024-01-20 at 22 12 46](https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/e568bff0-7212-413e-9eb8-770908c7f3e8)

I definitely took some creative liberties but I like that it captures the main elements of how I initially designed it and isn't an *exact* copy of the project. (But apparently I had to keep the glaring typos!)

### Day 21: January 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Fundamentals of CSS. Started Intro to Developing Websites locally 
- Started working on my creation **Learn CSS by Building a Set of Colored Markers** from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**:
I'm happy with the progress that I'm making on Codecademy. Where some of the concepts are a little too high-level and I'm not too sure how they come together I'm comforted knowing I've already started putting things into practice. I really like that the next unit will cover using VS Code, which I already have downloaded (from trying to use Python Notebooks). 

I also started working on my Building a Set of Colored Markers recreation. The idea is that I want to create a set of markers that show a set of different colour ways for the RGB model: primary, secondary, tertiary + complementary, monochromatic, analogous, triadic and tetradic. This means first learning about the models and having a solid enough foundation to translate them into CSS code. 

An hour of research and I barely did any coding hehe. 

---

### Day 22: January 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started building projects locally with VS Code 
- Started working on the code for my **RGB Colour Theory Markers** project

**Thoughts**:
I wish I had all the time in the world to work on coding. A minimum of an hour a day is better than nothing. I now know more about VS Code than I did before. I'm well on my way to have a pink theme with widgets in the corner like I see all the cool programmers doing it. 

I'm going through the Codecademy lesson again as I feel like there are some concepts that have sieved through my brain. I feel like in the long run having a strong grasp on how to use colour in my work will pay off.

---

### Day 23: January 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued creating my first local project using VSCode
- Continued working on the code for my **RGB Colour Theory Markers** project

**Thoughts**:
There's progress! Getting the code to match the concept in my head has really been a trust the process moment. While searching how to center a div within a div I realised that Flexbox and CSS Grid are coming up! I remember being thoroughly confused by them but I also think the my projects will end up looking infinitely better once I have a grasp of it. 

**Link to work:** [RGB Colour Theory Markers](https://codepen.io/ornellion/pen/eYXRPOp)

---

### Day 24: January 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed the First HTML/CSS local project video walkthrough. Also followed the complementary Beyond Basics video.
- Continued working on the code for my **RGB Colour Theory Markers** project

**Thoughts**:
Working in VSCode is actually easier since it autocompletes and links directly to documentation! I like seeing how things that I'm learning are coming together. My **RGB Colour Theory Markers** project is coming along nicely - I'm learning a lot about colour theory. I've decided to stop at the four basic colours: primary, seconday, tertiary and complementary colours. There's always more to add but I don't want to let the scope of the project run away from me when I still have the certification project to work on. 

**Link to work:** [RGB Colour Theory Markers](https://codepen.io/ornellion/pen/eYXRPOp)

---

### Day 25: January 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Developing with CSS - introduction to using Chrome Devtools
- Continued working on the code for my **RGB Colour Theory Markers** project

**Thoughts**:
Chrome Devtools is so cool! I hadn't realised that prototyping in the browser was a thing that could be done. I'd often wondered how people are able to identify elements from existing sites so easily. Apparently there's a tool for that! 

I'm also finally nearing the end of the Colour Theory Markers project. I think figuring out the gradients might prove a little tricky but should be fine once I figure out how the colours works together (or find a tool to help). And then I need to style the divs that hold the markers and then display them a little nicer too. Okay, so maybe not so near the end as I thought hehe

---

### Day 26: January 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started working on Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts Project - an off-platform project using VS Code. 
- Continued working on the code for my **RGB Colour Theory Markers** project

**Thoughts**:
I'm glad that the Codecademy path includes off-platform project and that they're better structured that the ones for the Data Science Foundations path. I feel like I actually have an idea of what I'm doing. For the Colour Theory Markers, the caps and sleeves are done and now I just need to figure out the gradients for the tertiary colours and add box shadows. Then it'll be a case of figuring out how to display them...

**Link to work:** [RGB Colour Theory Markers](https://codepen.io/ornellion/pen/eYXRPOp)

---


### Day 27: January 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts Project. 
- Finished working on the code for my **RGB Colour Theory Markers** project
- Created a repository for it on GitHub

**Thoughts**:
Today was the first day I spent more time coding on projects than I did following tutorials and I enjoyed the challenge! Even though the projects are relatively simple, I felt autonomous. If there was something I didn't know, I knew where to look for the answer. I also think it's because I'm making sure to take the time to make sure I understand the basics.

I took the freeCodeCamp project from this: 

![Screenshot 2024-01-27 at 21 11 10](https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/15c43c0d-75f0-4fa4-a6ef-db8125892e20)

and spent time figuring out how to code this: 

![Screenshot 2024-01-27 at 21 11 52](https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/d07fd4c4-7eb8-4a92-b1d0-a48e77cbee4c)

The next steps for me would be to make it responsive as well as interactive in some way but I understand that will come with time as I learn more CSS and also JavaScript. I think the fact that I now have a strong foundational understanding of RGB will serve me well moving forwards.

---

### Day 28: January 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started the unit on Deploying Websites. Learned about hosting and domain names.
- Learned the basics about using the command line using basic comands. 
- Started recreating freeCodeCamp's Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form

**Thoughts**:
If there's one thing that I've learned over the past month is that I'm learning a lot but it can also feel like I've learned very little...? I'm slowly becoming more comfortable coding in VS Code. The command line actually makes sense rather than being a bunch of abstract commands I can recreate in a tutorial. I can create and commit to repos in GitHub. *Actually* having a GitHub account is progress in itself. 

Yet, essentially after 3 months of coding I have a basic understanding of Python, HTML and CSS. But there's not much I can *do*. It's tempting to jump ahead to have more to show. I have to trust that the consistency and commitment to making sure my basic and higher-level understanding is solid will pay off in thye long-run. 

---

### Day 29: January 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Finished the unit on Deploying Websites by practicing basic commands
- Completed the Improved Styling With CSS: Color lesson
- Completed my recreation of freeCodeCamp's Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form

**Thoughts**:
HTML forms look simple but they're...deceptively confusing. I'm glad I took the time to go through the lesson on HTML forms again. I worked straight from VS Code rather than in Codepen which is actually easier in some ways. 

This is what's created in the course:

![Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 15 57 45](https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/6d7ada0b-2841-4bf1-b3cb-770815dee23b)

and I tried to change some elements and recreate something based on this [Odeon](https://www.odeon.co.uk/signup-my-odeon/) registration page. I added a header section, rearranged the form elements and changed up the styling. 

![Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 15 56 15](https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/8f40c5dd-54fc-4e66-8b6b-4db87b9d53f2)

I think the most frustrating thing so far is hitting the knowledge gap. I have an idea of what I want it to look like but at the moment I don't quite know how to get there yet. I hope one day (soon) I'll be able to look back and see how far I've come. 

**Link to work:** [Cinema Registration Form](https://github.com/ornellion/cinema-registration-form)

---

### Day 30: January 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed the Improved Styling with CSS: Colors Paint Store Project
- Completed Improved Styling with CSS: Typography lesson & quiz
- freeCodeCamp: Started working on the Certification Project: Survey Form. Completed the wireframe
- Updated the Cinema Registration repo as realised I hadn't linked the CSS properly 

**Thoughts**:
There's so much to CSS and I've only scratched the surface. I'm trying to remind myself that my future self will thank me for making sure that I've fully understood each concept before moving on to the next one.

I completed my wireframe for the [Build a Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form) Certification project based on the user stories. I prefer to do this by hand as it helps me have an idea of all the elements that should be included and think about the styling. Excited to see what the final project looks like compared to my initial ideas. 

---

### Day 31: January 31, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Improved Styling with CSS: Typography Project
- Started Web Development Foundations — Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet 
- freeCodeCamp: Started working on the Build a Survey Form HTML 

**Thoughts**:
In all my attempts at learning to code this is the first time I've done so much coding. With Codecademy including a challenge project I'm actually spending time in VS Code which is starting to feel more intuitive than working in a tutorial sandbox. Slowly, slowly, it's coming together.

---

### Day 32: February 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working Web Development Foundations — Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet
- Decided on the topic (Semantic HTML) and the structure of my table 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on the Build a Survey Form HTML - almost have all my form elements done 

**Thoughts**:
It feels oddly satisfying to start my 100 Days log with another month. Only 2 more to go! My thought process is starting to feel less disjointed and MDN Docs is my new best friend. I think it's a good sign that I now look forward to my days off so I have a solid chunk of time to code rather than an hour snatched here and there.

### Day 33: February 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working Web Development Foundations — Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet. Gathering the information that I want to enter into the table
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on the Build a Survey Form HTML. Completed the HTML structure. Most of the user stories passed except one: "Failed:All your radio buttons should have a value attribute and value."

**Thoughts**:
Other than a few little errors where I'd put a class instead of an id, my HTML structure is pretty sound! Struggling to figure out which of my radio buttons isn't passing the test. I wonder if it's the checkbox that are causing the issues... 

I got to use the HTML validator for the first time while trying to figure out where the error was occuring though! Looking forward to getting it to pass all the tests and then move onto the CSS.

### Day 34: February 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working Web Development Foundations — Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet. Finished gathering the information for the table.
- Finished the HTML structure for the Cheat Sheet table.
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on the Build a Survey Form HTML. Figured out why the last test was failing - I actually hadn't added the buttons!
- Passed the tests to complete the certification! 🎉 Started adding the CSS to style the form. 

**Thoughts**:
I'm enjoying working on two projects simultaneously. There's not really enough time to get bored and what I learn in one area, I can use in another. And really I don't have to look for a different colour scheme if I already have one. 

Juggling full-time work as well as coding is becoming easier. I'm steadily confirming that I'm a morning person, waking up at 4AM so I can have a solid 2 hours before work.

Also, how has it been 34 days and I've only just figured out how to use emojis using markdown in Github! 😅

### Day 35: February 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working Web Development Foundations — Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet. Working on the CSS 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on the Build a Survey Form HTML. Working on the CSS 

**Thoughts**:
I didn't think it was possible to spend over an hour grappling with CSS only for it to still not turn out how I want it to look like. I do think I have hit the wall of my current limited knowledge so I'm going to see how far I get tomorrow and accept whatever it looks like. 

My projects are only going to look better moving forward, and the only way to move forward is to not get stuck on these particular projects that are basically completed.

### Day 36: February 5, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed the Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet 🎉
- Started Improved Styling: Learn Links and Buttons unit 
- freeCodeCamp: Completed the Certification Project: Build a Survey Form 🎉

**Thoughts**:
I feel like I've been working on these projects forever but realistically it's only been a couple of hours given that I have to find time around a full-time job. 

I'm pretty proud of how my *Build Your Own Cheat Sheet* project turned out. I was able to review Semantic HTML Elements as wel as learning that you can use the hover element on table rows!

The freeCodeCamp *Survey Form* has a few responsiveness issues but I got to try a few different things like changing the colour of the radio and checkboxes to match the theme.

It matches my initial designs relatively closely. I need to put aside time to write more detailed descriptions of the projects in my Read Me documents of these projects before they start building up and I regret not having done it earlier 😅

### Day 37: February 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Improved Styling with CSS: Learn Links and Buttons unit chapter
- Started Learn Secondary Navigation chapter
- freeCodeCamp: Completed Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting course
- Started Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery course

**Thoughts**:
Back to learning we go! The Codecademy chapters are really giving my an in-depth explanation on Links, Buttons and Navigation from a UI/UX point of view. I might take some of their web design courses to complement the knowledge as I think it'd really help streamline with my project designs.

I don't think I'll recreate the Rothko Painting using CSS as it was a way to teach the Box Model that I already have a certain understanding about. I learned about the Filter and Transform properties though which are now. And now we have arrived at learning about CSS Flexbox! 

I remember feeling stumped about CSS Flexbox and Grid before but it doesn't seem so bad so far. I guess we'll see how much I've understood when I go to create my own Photo Gallery 👀

### Day 38: February 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued with Improved Styling with CSS: Learn Secondary Navigation
- freeCodeCamp: Completed Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery
- Started Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label 

**Thoughts**:
CSS Flexbox isn't actually that hard! I'll see what I think when I try and recreate it in my own projects I suppose. However, I think because this time around I have a basic understanding of Python 3, I'm finding concepts easier to understand as I'm not also trying to wrap my head around with the logic of learning a programming language. I'm just trying to understand the logic of Flexbox and that's coming easier. 

Plus, following two courses on the subject with distinct teaching styles means that I get to learn about the same topics from different angles and access different resources. I'm enjoying it and learning a lot 😊

### Day 39: February 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Improved Styling with CSS: Learn Secondary Navigation.
- Started learning about Wireframing 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label 

**Thoughts**:
I appreciate learning about wireframing so I can incorporate it in my future design process. I've got some ideas already of what my portfolio will eventually look like. I'm definitely going to recreate a Nutrition Label. There's a lot CSS that goes into it to replicate one and attempting to do so on my own would solidify some of the content that seems very vague to me at the moment. 

---

### Day 40: February 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed resources on wireframing and protoyping
- Read the requirements for Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System
- freeCodeCamp: Competed Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label course 🎉

**Thoughts**:
Recreating the Nutrition Label taught me a lot about the relationship between HTML elements such as <span> and the CSS to be able to create the desired styling. I also learned a lot about using classes - they're more reusable than I realised and keep code cleaner. Up until now I've definitely been using them more like IDs. I can also see how it's important to work on both the HTML and CSS as I go rather than being tempted to create the HTML first and then the CSS. No wonder I was getitng confused 😅

I'm excited to get into the next Codecademy project - building a website design system means getting to play around with colour palettes and typography!

### Day 41: February 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Created the wireframe for Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System 
- freeCodeCamp: Started Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz course

**Thoughts**:
Wireframing has to be my favourite part of the process. And now I have more knowledge about how to create a more effective wireframe I'm focusing more on having the essential elements and labelling so that I have a solid foundation when I do go to code. If I've learned anything is that time spent on having a solid foundation isn't time wasted. It helps me understand what I can already do and what I'll need to spend more time researching on what to do. 

I can also see how freeCodeCamp's curriculum has changed since the last time I attempted it. I find that key elements are repeated enough and in different ways to solidify previous knowledge. Unless there's something in a course I really want to recreate I think I might focus on completing the certification projects. I feel much more confident in my coding than when I started the Web Design Certification. 💚

### Day 42: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started picking content for Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz course

**Thoughts**:
Designers are actually amazing. Picking a colour palette is an art! I have a tendency to have decision paralysis so I might have to give myself an option of like 3 colour palettes and then pick the one I like one morning or I'll spend the next couple days quibbling over colours and fonts. I want to include a Dark Mode so this might also narrow down the scope.

Accessibility is also a much broader topic than I imagined. I want to eventually read more about it. I hadn't realised just how important it is to making the web accessible to all. 

---

### Day 43: February 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started writing the code Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz course

**Thoughts**:
I decided to not spend too much time on the actual content of my Website Design System and have started writing the code. I'm trying a different approach by writing both the HTML and CSS at the same time and working from top to bottom. It really does make me question how much I've learned over the past 40 days 😅 I suppose the only way to get better is to keep coding. For everything else there's Google. 

---

### Day 44: February 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued writing the code Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz course

**Thoughts**:
It took a lot to sit in front of my computer and code today. I know that missing one day isn't the end of the world but I also know myself enough to know one day very easily turns into one year without coding. The code for the Challenge Project is coming along nicely. My understanding of Flexbox? Not so much. 

I hadn't imagined the learning curve that comes with CSS Flexbox using freeCodeCamp. There's just not enough material there for me to truly understand what I'm doing. Luckily I think there are plenty of fun resources out there to help.

### Day 45: February 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued with Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System.
- Finished the Colours Section, started on the Fonts. 
- freeCodeCamp: Completed Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz course 🎉
- Started working on Certification Project: Tribute Page - understanding the User Stories and picking a topic 

**Thoughts**:
It's that time of the month when I'm working on two projects at once! The main roadblock I'm encountering with building the Website Design System is the feeling that I won't be able to recreate the wireframe. Except that when I take it one section at a time it's coming together. It's the little things like being uncertain about Flex. 

The Tribute Page and the User Stories are relatively simple however I do want to create something visually interesting and pushes me out me comfort zone. I suppose I'll see what I come up with! 😅

---

### Day 46: February 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued with Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System.
- Continued with the Fonts. Encountered an issue with child overflow of the parent container
- freeCodeCamp: Continued wrking on Certification Project: Tribute Page
- Completed the wireframe in keeping with the user stories  

**Thoughts**:
The main issue here is definitely that I want to use Flexbox but I...don't know how. Since Flexbox is a way of aligning items in a container, I figure if I create the containers first I can then figure out how to align them...? Basically I'm going to create the content for the projects and then take some time out to make sure I've understood Flexbox and what I'm trying to do with it. I'll figure it out 🤞

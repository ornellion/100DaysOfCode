### Day 1: March 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued learning about Flexbox
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on Tribute page project 

**Thoughts**:

Getting back into the swing of things easier said than done. I think choosing to have a "fresh start" has helped more than trying to power through when it already felt like I had "failed" the #100DaysofCode Challenge. I still think it's pretty incredible that I coded 50 days straight. If this is my current limit before hitting a wall then I'd rather work with it rather than taking away how much I enjoy coding. 

What I'm learning about Flexbox in Codecademy I'm applying to my Tribute Page. I've already passed the tests but I want to challenge myself to tweak it until it's as close to my original wireframe/idea. The more I tweak, the more I figure things out! 

---

### Day 2: March 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed the Flexbox unit lesson and guided To Do App exercise
- Started on the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy 
- freeCodeCamp: Almost done with the Tribute Page! 

**Thoughts**:

I'm almost done with the Tribute Page! üòå I'm glad that I kept going until it looked like what I'd envisioned. All that remains are a few stylistic tweakings like the accent colour and fixing the strip of white at the bottom of the page and I'll be done! Right in time to start another project...

I'm not sure why I'm taken by surprise every time I'm expected to complete a project üòÖ The Codecademy Off-Platform Project is the first that has just provided a design spec and resources and sent us off on our merry way. Even while knowing there's no right and wrong to complete the perfectionist is certain there's a way to do it wrong. 

---

### Day 3: March 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Codecademy: Continued working on the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy
- Finished navbar - started working on hero image
- freeCodeCamp: Finally completed the [Tribute Page - Ron Weasley](https://github.com/ornellion/tribute-page-ron-weasley)! üéâ

**Thoughts**:
I had another couple of days off for health reasons but since it was only a couple of days it made sense to just jump right back in and keep going. And I'm so glad that I finally got the Tribute Page to where it passed the tests and I was happy with the way it looked! 

https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/1e3b3e1a-11d1-44f3-8783-6525efaa3953

I'm happy with the progress I've made with making a website responsive too. It's the first time I've liked the way a project has looked on my phone. And I've still got so much to learn üòÖ

It's interesting how far I feel like I've come but also how much further I have to go. Working on the Codecademy Off-Platform Project feels easier to get stuck into than it did a couple of weeks ago even though the learning curve feels...steeper? I think it's because I have a better idea of what to Google now and how to add that to my code.

### Day 4: March 8, 2024 üíú

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working on the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy
- freeCodeCamp: Started Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet

**Thoughts**:

Returning to coding with the built-in text editor after living in VSCode for my projects can be such a shock! What do you mean I have to close my own tags?? 

Building a Balance Sheet isn't the most exciting thing but I'm cementing knowledge I learned earlier on when it was covered in Codecademy. I'm also excited to get to the part of the pseudo selectors so I can start doing lots of snazzy things with my CSS. 

---

### Day 5: March 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Decided to focus on completing the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy üéâ

**Thoughts**:

Some days I like to switch between learning and working on projects but today I wanted to get stuck into the project and see it through to the end. I think start to finish it would have only taken me around 4 hours. However doing 30 mins a day can end up feeling like I'm taking longer on something that's relatively easy. 

It wasn't an _exact_ recreation but I stayed loyal to the design specification and it helped me understand why there are so many different techniques with web development. Where one thing doesn't work another one will but it might not work with something used later in the code. 

I'm much more confident using Flexbox now and can't wait to get stuck into learning about CSS Grid!

### Day 6: March 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started Learn CSS: Grid Unit. Learning the basics of Grid 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet

**Thoughts**:

Writing the HTML for the freeCodeCamp Balance Sheet has been thoroughly...unexciting. What's kept me going has been looking forward to what I'll learn about CSS. Combined with what I'm learning about CSS, I'm excited to making my projects even more responsive. And this is all without JavaScript! 

I think taking yesterday to just focus on a project helped to remind me that this goes beyond a career switch. I enjoy learning and seeing my progressive progess ‚ú® 

---

### Day 7: March 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued Learn CSS: Grid Unit. Completed Grid Essentials  
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet (68% complete) 

**Thoughts**:

CSS Grid and pseudoselectors most definitely don't come naturally to me. I'm also slightly overwhelmed by the different ways there are to refactor CSS Grid statements. I suppose at the start my code will start of long and inefficient. Over time I hope refactoring to one line code will become instinctual!  

---

### Day 8: March 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued learning Advanced CSS Grid 
- freeCodeCamp:Continued Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet (92% complete) 

**Thoughts**:

Okay, CSS Grid may be confusing but it's also awesome! I can't wait to overuse it in my coming projects as I get to grips with it üòé I'm particularly a fan of `grid-template-areas` property and think I'll be able to bring my layouts to life in a more responsive way. 

CSS Selectors are also pretty cool but when I think it'll take me awhile to remember that I can use the `:nth-of-type()` pseudo-selectors to target specific elements. Why have short code when long code will do? (I'm sure I'll learn that along the way)

---

### Day 9: March 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Advanced CSS Grid & Quiz 
- freeCodeCamp: Finished Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet üéâ
- Started Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting.

**Thoughts**:

Why can I never remember how to set the HTML boilerplate? üòÖ Since I use VSCode for my off-platform projects I rarely set it from scratch. CSS Grid has a _lot_ of properties to remember and I know I won't really get to grasp until I'm using it more regularly. I felt the same sort of overwhelm with CSS Flex but once I got the hang of it I enjoyed using it. 

Not sure how I feel about `linear-gradient()` function though. I'm a little stumped if I'm honest... 

---

### Day 10: March 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Advanced CSS Grid Practice Projects (Pup Spa, Task Grid)
- Started Learn Responsive Design - Sizing Elements 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting (45% complete) 

**Thoughts**:

I'm a little disappointed there wasn't an Off-Platform project that uses CSS Grid. I suppose there are two upcoming Challenge Projects that might allow me to flex my knowledge. It'll be useful to tackle them armed with more knowledge of sizing elements. At the moment I use just what works üòÖ 

I'm 88% of the way with Web Development Foundations which on the one hand is testatement to how far I've come but this is only the first module! Combined with the freeCodeCamp certificate at least I'll have a solid foundation. 

---

### Day 11: March 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Learn Responsive Design - Sizing Elements 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting (73% complete)

**Thoughts**:

I finally understand the difference between `em` and `rem` in responsive sizing! I had wondered what root element was being referred to... I also have some time off coming up so looking forward to spending more time coding than making an hour here and there üòÅ

---

### Day 12: March 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Learn Responsive Design - Media Queries
- Learned about Device Mode in [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode)
- Completed Project: Tsunami Coffee 
- freeCodeCamp: Completed Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting üéâ
- Started Learn Responsive Design by Building a Piano (40%)

**Thoughts**:

Media queries have come a long way since I first toyed with the idea of learning how to code! I remember feeling overwhelmed at the idea of setting breakpoints to match the multitude of devices out there. I'm glad that it's now being taught to set breakpoints according to where a project might naturally start breaking. The Device Mode in Chrome DevTool is handy not just for that but for taking screenshots of my projects moving forward! üëç

I'm not feeling the freeCodeCamp projects at the moment but I can see how previous knowledge is being built upon with each one. Likle I didn't know it was possible to target all pseudo element to remove default values. I learn something new every time I sit in front of my laptop.

---

### Day 13: March 17, 2024 üçÄ

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Documentation and Research
- Read the specification for Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic
- freeCodeCamp: Completed Learn Responsive Design by Building a Piano üéâ
- Started looking at User Stories for Technical Documentation Page Project 

**Thoughts**:

I'm not sure why I'm always so surprised that coding involves actual coding! üòÖ I could have sworn I _just_ completed a project but here we are again. The Fotomatic one seems simple enough but then it's followed by two challenge projects to complete Codecademy __Web Development Foundations__ before the certification exams! 

There are also only 4 more freeCodeCamp lessons and 2 projects after the Technical Documentation Page before I complete the __Responsive Web Design Certification__. JavaScript comes this way ü§ì

---

### Day 14: March 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started working on Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

**Thoughts**:

I decided to work on one project at a time and I'm not enjoying this or this particular project ü•≤ 

The idea is to fix a broken responsive website from the code, design specs and the final product. My initial thoughts were to give up and move on to something different however I realise that it'll be rare that I get to build something from the ground up. It's more likely that I'll be given code that's not working and it's up to me to debug it and fix it. It took me 25 mins to work out it wasn't linked to the right stylesheet... üòÖ

---

### Day 15: March 19, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working on Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

**Thoughts**:

I thought this was going to be simple! üôÉ I thought it was going to be a case of spotting the mistakes in the CSS but it turned out there were errors in the HTML too, such as incorrect image locations. Once I started spotting the trends I kind of got into the flow. Now I need to make sure that the responsive design matches the design spec at the specific breakpoints... 

I also learned of the importances of having a reset stylesheet to remove default styling! That also had me stumped for awhile. Thank goodness for the Chrome DevTools. I'm glad I didn't skip this project because I'm honestly learning more than I thought I would yesterday. 

---

### Day 16: March 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working on Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

**Thoughts**:

Why are media queries like this?? Progress is being made but at what cost? It took me 20 minutes to realise that a button can't display if there isn't actually one in the HTML üôÉ I'm sure there is a better process to doing this but as a lowly beginner it's very much a trial-and-error approach and currently erring closer to error. 

---

### Day 17: March 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Finished working on [Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic](https://github.com/ornellion/codecademy-fotomatic) üéâ

**Thoughts**:

Fixed it! Well, close enough. And on this learning joruney close enough is good enough for me. 

<img width="858" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-21 at 08 05 57" src="https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/5e501296-563c-468c-801c-9e1ea62f34be">

I learned that reading someone else's code isn't that easy (and I imagine going back and reading your own code isn't either). Chrome DevTools is a life-send. Simple errors such as forgetting to declare the classes or not linking the stylesheets properly make a massive difference. I also need to follow a video on GitHub at some point as I'm not sure I know what I'm doing ü•≤ 

---

### Day 18: March 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Took a look at the project goals & requirements for Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox
- freeCodeCamp: Started on Build a Technical Documentation Page Project 

**Thoughts**:

More projects! Decided to return to working on two projects in tandem but have a more casual approach by coding on my laptop with CSI in the background. It makes more sense for my shorter coding sessions or when it feels like a chore or rather than a fun project I'm working on. 

One of the hardest parts can be deciding on the subject matter though. The current Codecademy project is a Company Home Page and the next freeCodeCamp project is a Product Landing Page so I might link the two. Definitely gets the creativity going ‚ú®

---

### Day 19: March 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on Build a Technical Documentation Page Project 

**Thoughts**:

Adding content to the website is longer than expected. For something that's more content heavy I decided to work on the HTML before the CSS and then make it responsive. I have plenty of projects to work on and change my approach if there is a better way to do it. 

---

### Day 20: March 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on Build a Technical Documentation Page Project 

**Thoughts**:

Passed 13/15 tests üôå It's insane how a simply typo can take 30 minutes to find... I think I prefer working on multiple projects in tandem but at the same time I make more progress working on one project at a time as I can build momentum. I suppose everything has its pros and cons. 

---

### Day 21: March 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- freeCodeCamp: Completed the [Build a Technical Documentation Page Project](https://ornellion.github.io/technical-documentation-page/) üéâ

**Thoughts**:

After about 6 hours, the project passed the tests and is complete! 

![Technical-Documentation-Screenshot1](https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/15060c72-c55a-48cd-9e3e-0de25f70c4d9)

I think I do need to consider taking a course in styling as I can tell the colours aren't quite right overall - like there's perhaps too many colours or it doesn't flow right. I went with a dark scheme since I predominantly use Dark Mode but I also know that's not the case for everyone. Now on to the next project! 

---

### Day 22: March 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started the Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

**Thoughts**:

Can I just say that the hardest part of these projects is the design process! I have to pick the topic, design the page, pick the colour scheme and the fonts... And then actually code it üòÖ

Using Canva was helpful to help give me a general idea of what I want the final results to look like as well as visualise what the fonts and the colours will ultimately look like. I even have the assets so onto coding next! 

---

### Day 23: March 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working on the Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

**Thoughts**:

I wouldn't say I'm necessarily faster but I feel like things are clicking into place faster. I have a better idea of what I'm doing wrong and what I need to search for in order to get my CSS to look closer to my design. I hadn't realised that working to design specs has made it easier to code following my own design. 

And even though this is a Flexbox challenge I can't help but think it would be easier to complete with CSS Grid... 

---

### Day 24: March 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working on the Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

**Thoughts**:

Ahhh I logged yesterday after midnight so it shows up as today's contribution üòÖ I've made more progress with the Homepage. All the elements are there but it doesn't look quite right. Designing for desktop is actually harder than expected. There's more whitespace than on a tablet or a mobile and so creating a minimalist design that's still impactful is easier said than done. And with CSS it can sometimes be hard to understand why one rule works in one place and not in another. usally turns out that I'm not selecting the right class...

---

### Day 25: March 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working on the Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

**Thoughts**:

My current issue is that the page only looks good at around tablet size (768px) ü•≤ Any bigger than 1290px and it doesn't look right, which I can only spot when working on my monitor otherwise I'm under the impression that it works. That said, the example site has the same sort of issue as if that's possibly an inherent limitation of using Flexbox... ü§î 

I've decided I'm going to stick to 3 sizes: laptop, tablet and mobile and use media queries to change around the design appropriately. However I can also see myself spending way too much time on this if I'm not careful. It's 100% the little details that take the most time. Once you change one thing, it impacts everything else. Thank goodness for Chrome DevTools. I definitely need to use it more but when I forget what changes I've made it's hard to then and change it in the actual document... 

---

### Day 26: March 31, 2024 üéÄ

**Today's Progress**:
- Codecademy: Finished working on the [Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox](https://ornellion.github.io/company-homepage-flexbox/) üéâ

**Thoughts**:

Finally finished the Challenge Project! I think one of the biggest takeaways that resizing images is a nightmare and it might be easier to already have the assets at the size that I want them rather than trying to make them responsive by code üòÖ There are still some elements that didn't look quite like how I want them but I was able to put everything I've learned about Flexbox into practice, and done is always better than perfect üôå

![Screenshot 2024-03-31 at 19 20 23](https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/912e45e9-ee9e-413b-8372-54bc4c4143be)

Onto the final Codecademy project **for the Responsive Web Design unit** before the certification exams! 

---

### Day 27: April 1, 2024 

**Today's Progress**:
- Codecademy: Started working on the Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website 

**Thoughts**:

Another day, another project design. Deciding on the project elements isn't taking as long as it used to at least, especially since I've desiged style guides and now have favourite fonts üòÖ I think I'm going to use CSS Grid for this project even if it relatively simple as I've predominantly used Flex and want to have some practice using Grid. 

---

### Day 28: April 2, 2024 

**Today's Progress**:
- Codecademy: Continued working on the Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website 

**Thoughts**:

Using CSS Grid is a little confusing but it feels easier to make things responsive as well as providing more overall control to the way things are laid out on the page. Media queries are also going from being a project requirement to being one of my favourite tools. I have the idea of a mobile-first approach in mind, but since I'm usually coding on a desktop/laptop it feels more intuitive to code that first before coding the mobile. 

I still have to Google pretty much everything but I'm happy to find what I'm looking for faster and my bookmarks grow every day! 

---

### Day 29: April 3, 2024 

**Today's Progress**:
- Codecademy: Finished working on the [Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website](https://ornellion.github.io/responsive-club-website/)
- Completed **Web Development Foundations** courses - still have 2 examinations to obtain the certificate 

**Thoughts**:

A simple website is easy (and fast) to code!

![screenshot](https://github.com/ornellion/100DaysOfCode/assets/155359289/bfb57a3d-8871-4881-9384-376882dbb45b)

With that, that's the Codecademy **Web Development Foundations** courses completed! Now I have 2 objective examinations to complete in order to get the certification. I also have 4 courses and 2 projects to complete in order to get the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification Project üíÉ 

---

### Day 30: April 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed **Web Development Foundations** Certification Exams - 96% and 100% pass mark for the two exams! üéä
- Started **Introduction: JavaScript Syntax, Part I** Unit. Currently on the Introduction to JS.  
- freeCodeCamp: Started **Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline** course. (75/118 completed) 

**Thoughts**:

I decided that I would started learning about JavaScript on CodeCademy while I continue completing the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. On the one hand I am doubling up on material which means it's taking a little longer to complete. On the other hand, CodeCademy didn't cover things like CSS Variables which I'm grateful to now have a working knowledge of. 

I've also found that Codecademy provides a higher level understanding of the material which makes it easier for me to connect the different concepts together wherease the freeCodeCamp exercises are repetitive and I end up picking up things because I'm doing them over and over again. 

There's a benefit to building a strong foundation and I need to remember that when I feel like sprinting ahead üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

---

### Day 31: April 5, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Continued with **Introduction: JavaScript Syntax, Part I** Unit. Currently learning about Variables.  
- freeCodeCamp: Continued **Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline** course. (103/118 completed) 

**Thoughts**:

I'm glad to find that I was right that learning Python first would make JavaScript feel less intimidating. `console.log()` works in a similar way to `print()` in Python. I have a foundation for learning JS that I wouldn't have if I was discovering it for the first time after HTML/CSS. It's something I had struggled with before. 

It's also interesting to see how variables are used in CSS while learning how they're used in JS. It brings it all nicely together üòä

---

### Day 32: April 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Continued with **Introduction: JavaScript Syntax, Part I** Unit. Continued learning about Variables.  
- freeCodeCamp: Completed **Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline** course üéâ

**Thoughts**:

In a way going through the basics of JavaScript syntax is helping to make sense of things that had previously confused me when learning Python. I didn't really understand string interpolation before but it makes sense now. I think it'll take me awhile to learn the difference between using `const` and `let` but all good things come with time and practice! 

I also learned more than I expected with the CSS Variables course. Now onto a refresher of CSS Grid! 

---

### Day 33: April 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Continued with **Introduction: JavaScript Syntax, Part I** Unit. Started learning about Conditionals.  
- freeCodeCamp: Started **Learn CSS Grid by Building a Magazine** course (25% completed) 

**Thoughts**:

It seems converting Kelvin to Celsius and human years into dog years are common projects to understand how variables work üòÖ I'm pretty sure I did something similar when I was learning Python on the Codecademy platform! Continuing with CSS Grid feels a bit like a step back when I want to get stuck into JS buuut there are little practical tips that you get from freeCodeCamp. And the continual exercises mean that I feel like I'm continuing to code as opposed to simply reading about the theory... 

---

### Day 34: April 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Continued with **Introduction: JavaScript Syntax, Part I** Unit. Continued learning about Conditionals.
- freeCodeCamp: Started **Learn CSS Grid by Building a Magazine** course (64% completed) 

**Thoughts**:

I did not expect to come across the terms *Truthy* and *Falsy* in my JavaScript journey but here we are üòÖ It's nice that I already have a foundation but am learning the differences specific to JS, like using `&&` instead of `and` for the logical operator. I also like having a practical step-by-step example of how CSS Grid is used. It's similar to Flexbox but also very different and there were some subtle differences I hadn't noticed until now. 

---

### Day 35: April 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Continued with **Introduction: JavaScript Syntax, Part I** Unit. Started Magic 8 Ball Project.
- freeCodeCamp: Completed **Learn CSS Grid by Building a Magazine** course üéâ

**Thoughts**:

There are little things in JavaScript that I hope I end up continuing to do like refactoring `if...else` statements using ternary operators or using the switch keyword instead. It's only the basics but so far I'm enjoying JavaScript far more than I did when I tried to learn to code for the first time almost a decade ago. 

I'm also learning little CSS tricks like the `column-width` property. Where were you when I needed you? ü•≤

---

### Day 36: April 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Continued with **Introduction: JavaScript Syntax, Part I** Unit. Completed Magic 8 Ball Project.
- freeCodeCamp: Completed **Learn CSS Animation by Building a Ferris Wheel** course üéâ

**Thoughts**:

The Magic 8 Ball is simple enough - decided to take some time to make sure that I could complete it using both `if/else if/else` and `switch` statements. Took me a little while to grasp the logic rather than referring blindly to previous examples. I'm slowly beginning to Codecademy using AI Hints - it's more interactive but sometimes it's also just...wrong 

Also completed the quick freeCodeCamp course on CSS Animation. I don't see (right now) what I'll be animating but who knows. Maybe I'll find creating CSS art a fun hobby! 

---

### Day 37: April 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Continued with **Introduction: JavaScript Syntax, Part I** Unit. Completed Race Day project.
- Started learning about Functions
- freeCodeCamp: Started **Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin** course (29% completed)

**Thoughts**:

Oh functions, how I missed you so! ü•≤ All my Python knowledge is coming back, even if it's tripping me up a little when it comes to syntax. There are subtle but important nuances. Also started the final course for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification üôå I've come this far it makes sense to complete the final two projects and gain the certification! That way both of the resources will be going through JavaScript! 

---

### Day 38: April 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- freeCodeCamp: Completed **Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin** course üéâ
- Started **Build a Product Landing Page** project 

**Thoughts**:

Made progress with completing the freeCodeCamp certification. As always, coming up with the idea and design is always the hardest part of it. And I would have thought that over 3 months in now creating a fixed navigation bar would come more naturally! üòÖ I'm looking forward to my projects having more interactivity through JavaScript and learning about all the libraries we have access to! I feel like I've leanred a lot but barely scratched the surgace. 

---

### Day 39: April 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- freeCodeCamp: Completed the **[Build a Product Landing Page](https://github.com/ornellion/freecodecamp-product-landing-page)** project üéâ


**Thoughts**:

Created the most basic of sites to pass the tests as I'd run out of creativity üòÖ

Currently potentially having an issue with linking the stylesheet on GitHub but that is a problem for another day... Just one more project to go!

### Day 40: April 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- freeCodeCamp: Started the **Personal Portfolio Webpage** Project 

**Thoughts**:

Finally onto the final project for the freeCodeCamp certification! I've come so far - 40 days of (almost) daily coding is something to be proud of and it's really become part of my regular routine. I'm currently designing my portfolio in Canva as I've found it's easier to build to a design spec rather than trying to figure things as I go. I'm also often far more hapy with the finished product as a result.

### Day 41: April 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- freeCodeCamp: Continued the **Personal Portfolio Webpage** Project 

**Thoughts**:

I had to take a week off from coding for personal reasons. I debated with starting over however completing the Web Development foundations within this round was one of my aims for these 50 days and if I keep going every day until 1st May, I'll have completed it and be able to focus on JavaScript for the next round. I feel like being a perfectionist and expecting things to go a particular way is how I've stopped for longer periods in the past.

Today I completed the HTML structure of the Portfolio as I feel it's relatively simple and so a holistic approach will be better. It's more the CSS and getting the resources exactly how I want them that might be fiddly but this is an overally simple project. I'm excited to get stuck in again üí™

### Day 42: April 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- freeCodeCamp: Continued the **Personal Portfolio Webpage** Project 

**Thoughts**:

One day centering a div will be second nature and won't take quite as long üòÖ Progress has been made! 9/11 of the tests have been passed and I'm about 30% done. The project section will be the most fiddly purely because it has the most resources and links but shouldn't take much longer. It's been a good way of getting back into coding regularly.

### Day 42: April 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- freeCodeCamp: Continued the **Personal Portfolio Webpage** Project 

**Thoughts**: 

I always have this thought mid-project but designing is not for the faint of heart. I think I'm going to have to start stalking sites like Behance to start honing my creativity and design sense. Progress has been made, though I'm not entirely sure what I've done wrong with the navbar that it won't pass the test. But that is a problem for another day!

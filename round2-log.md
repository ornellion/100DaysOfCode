### Day 1: March 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued learning about Flexbox
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on Tribute page project 

**Thoughts**:

Getting back into the swing of things easier said than done. I think choosing to have a "fresh start" has helped more than trying to power through when it already felt like I had "failed" the #100DaysofCode Challenge. I still think it's pretty incredible that I coded 50 days straight. If this is my current limit before hitting a wall then I'd rather work with it rather than taking away how much I enjoy coding. 

What I'm learning about Flexbox in Codecademy I'm applying to my Tribute Page. I've already passed the tests but I want to challenge myself to tweak it until it's as close to my original wireframe/idea. The more I tweak, the more I figure things out!

### Day 2: March 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed the Flexbox unit lesson and guided To Do App exercise
- Started on the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy 
- freeCodeCamp: Almost done with the Tribute Page! 

**Thoughts**:
I'm almost done with the Tribute Page! ðŸ˜Œ I'm glad that I kept going until it looked like what I'd envisioned. All that remains are a few stylistic tweakings like the accent colour and fixing the strip of white at the bottom of the page and I'll be done! Right in time to start another project...

I'm not sure why I'm taken by surprise every time I'm expected to complete a project ðŸ˜… The Codecademy Off-Platform Project is the first that has just provided a design spec and resources and sent us off on our merry way. Even while knowing there's no right and wrong to complete the perfectionist is certain there's a way to do it wrong.

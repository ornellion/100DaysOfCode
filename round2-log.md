### Day 1: March 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued learning about Flexbox
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on Tribute page project 

**Thoughts**:
Getting back into the swing of things easier said than done. I think choosing to have a "fresh start" has helped more than trying to power through when it already felt like I had "failed" the #100DaysofCode Challenge. I still think it's pretty incredible that I coded 50 days straight. If this is my current limit before hitting a wall then I'd rather work with it rather than taking away how much I enjoy coding. 

What I'm learning about Flexbox in Codecademy I'm applying to my Tribute Page. I've already passed the tests but I want to challenge myself to tweak it until it's as close to my original wireframe/idea. The more I tweak, the more I figure things out!

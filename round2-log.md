### Day 1: March 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued learning about Flexbox
- freeCodeCamp: Continued working on Tribute page project 

**Thoughts**:

Getting back into the swing of things easier said than done. I think choosing to have a "fresh start" has helped more than trying to power through when it already felt like I had "failed" the #100DaysofCode Challenge. I still think it's pretty incredible that I coded 50 days straight. If this is my current limit before hitting a wall then I'd rather work with it rather than taking away how much I enjoy coding. 

What I'm learning about Flexbox in Codecademy I'm applying to my Tribute Page. I've already passed the tests but I want to challenge myself to tweak it until it's as close to my original wireframe/idea. The more I tweak, the more I figure things out!

### Day 2: March 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed the Flexbox unit lesson and guided To Do App exercise
- Started on the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy 
- freeCodeCamp: Almost done with the Tribute Page! 

**Thoughts**:

I'm almost done with the Tribute Page! üòå I'm glad that I kept going until it looked like what I'd envisioned. All that remains are a few stylistic tweakings like the accent colour and fixing the strip of white at the bottom of the page and I'll be done! Right in time to start another project...

I'm not sure why I'm taken by surprise every time I'm expected to complete a project üòÖ The Codecademy Off-Platform Project is the first that has just provided a design spec and resources and sent us off on our merry way. Even while knowing there's no right and wrong to complete the perfectionist is certain there's a way to do it wrong.

### Day 3: March 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

- Codecademy: Continued working on the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy
- Finished navbar - started working on hero image
- freeCodeCamp: Finally completed the [Tribute Page - Ron Weasley](https://github.com/ornellion/tribute-page-ron-weasley)! üéâ

**Thoughts**:
I had another couple of days off for health reasons but since it was only a couple of days it made sense to just jump right back in and keep going. And I'm so glad that I finally got the Tribute Page to where it passed the tests and I was happy with the way it looked!

I'm happy with the progress I've made with making a website responsive too. It's the first time I've liked the way a project has looked on my phone. And I've still got so much to learn üòÖ

It's interesting how far I feel like I've come but also how much further I have to go. Working on the Codecademy Off-Platform Project feels easier to get stuck into than it did a couple of weeks ago even though the learning curve feels...steeper? I think it's because I have a better idea of what to Google now and how to add that to my code.

### Day 4: March 8, 2024 üíú

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued working on the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy
- freeCodeCamp: Started Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet

**Thoughts**:

Returning to coding with the built-in text editor after living in VSCode for my projects can be such a shock! What do you mean I have to close my own tags?? 

Building a Balance Sheet isn't the most exciting thing but I'm cementing knowledge I learned earlier on when it was covered in Codecademy. I'm also excited to get to the part of the pseudo selectors so I can start doing lots of snazzy things with my CSS.

### Day 5: March 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Decided to focus on completing the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy üéâ

**Thoughts**:

Some days I like to switch between learning and working on projects but today I wanted to get stuck into the project and see it through to the end. I think start to finish it would have only taken me around 4 hours. However doing 30 mins a day can end up feeling like I'm taking longer on something that's relatively easy. 

It wasn't an _exact_ recreation but I stayed loyal to the design specification and it helped me understand why there are so many different techniques with web development. Where one thing doesn't work another one will but it might not work with something used later in the code. 

I'm much more confident using Flexbox now and can't wait to get stuck into learning about CSS Grid!

### Day 6: March 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Started Learn CSS: Grid Unit. Learning the basics of Grid 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet

**Thoughts**:

Writing the HTML for the freeCodeCamp Balance Sheet has been thoroughly...unexciting. What's kept me going has been looking forward to what I'll learn about CSS. Combined with what I'm learning about CSS, I'm excited to making my projects even more responsive. And this is all without JavaScript! 

I think taking yesterday to just focus on a project helped to remind me that this goes beyond a career switch. I enjoy learning and seeing my progressive progess ‚ú®

### Day 7: March 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued Learn CSS: Grid Unit. Completed Grid Essentials  
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet (68% complete) 

**Thoughts**:

CSS Grid and pseudoselectors most definitely don't come naturally to me. I'm also slightly overwhelmed by the different ways there are to refactor CSS Grid statements. I suppose at the start my code will start of long and inefficient. Over time I hope refactoring to one line code will become instinctual!

### Day 8: March 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Continued learning Advanced CSS Grid 
- freeCodeCamp:Continued Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet (92% complete) 

**Thoughts**:

Okay, CSS Grid may be confusing but it's also awesome! I can't wait to overuse it in my coming projects as I get to grips with it üòé I'm particularly a fan of `grid-template-areas` property and think I'll be able to bring my layouts to life in a more responsive way. 

CSS Selectors are also pretty cool but when I think it'll take me awhile to remember that I can use the `:nth-of-type()` pseudo-selectors to target specific elements. Why have short code when long code will do? (I'm sure I'll learn that along the way)

### Day 9: March 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Advanced CSS Grid & Quiz 
- freeCodeCamp: Finished Learn More about CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet üéâ
- Started Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting.

**Thoughts**:

Why can I never remember how to set the HTML boilerplate? üòÖ Since I use VSCode for my off-platform projects I rarely set it from scratch. CSS Grid has a _lot_ of properties to remember and I know I won't really get to grasp until I'm using it more regularly. I felt the same sort of overwhelm with CSS Flex but once I got the hang of it I enjoyed using it. 

Not sure how I feel about `linear-gradient()` function though. I'm a little stumped if I'm honest...

### Day 10: March 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Advanced CSS Grid Practice Projects (Pup Spa, Task Grid)
- Started Learn Responsive Design - Sizing Elements 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting (45% complete) 

**Thoughts**:

I'm a little disappointed there wasn't an Off-Platform project that uses CSS Grid. I suppose there are two upcoming Challenge Projects that might allow me to flex my knowledge. It'll be useful to tackle them armed with more knowledge of sizing elements. At the moment I use just what works üòÖ 

I'm 88% of the way with Web Development Foundations which on the one hand is testatement to how far I've come but this is only the first module! Combined with the freeCodeCamp certificate at least I'll have a solid foundation.

### Day 11: March 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Learn Responsive Design - Sizing Elements 
- freeCodeCamp: Continued Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting (73% complete)

**Thoughts**:

I finally understand the difference between `em` and `rem` in responsive sizing! I had wondered what root element was being referred to... I also have some time off coming up so looking forward to spending more time coding than making an hour here and there üòÅ

### Day 12: March 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Codecademy: Completed Learn Responsive Design - Media Queries
- Learned about Device Mode in [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode)
- Completed Project: Tsunami Coffee 
- freeCodeCamp: Completed Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting üéâ
- Started Learn Responsive Design by Building a Piano (40%)

**Thoughts**:

Media queries have come a long way since I first toyed with the idea of learning how to code! I remember feeling overwhelmed at the idea of setting breakpoints to match the multitude of devices out there. I'm glad that it's now being taught to set breakpoints according to where a project might naturally start breaking. The Device Mode in Chrome DevTool is handy not just for that but for taking screenshots of my projects moving forward! üëç

I'm not feeling the freeCodeCamp projects at the moment but I can see how previous knowledge is being built upon with each one. Likle I didn't know it was possible to target all pseudo element to remove default values. I learn something new every time I sit in front of my laptop.

# 100DaysOfCode
My repository to document my attempts at completing 100 Days of Code.

The **Round 1** Log (started 1 January 2024) can be found [here](OVERVIEW-Round1.md). 

I managed to hit 50 days and then found that I wasn't coding to learn anymore but to complete the challenge. Decided that it would be more productive to split the challenge into two until I build more mental muscle. 

The **Round 2** Log of 50 days of Code can be found [here]().
